# My dotfiles

Inspired by [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani/dotfiles/).

## Installation / Getting started
I leave it up to you to pick what you like. Run `install-deps.sh` to get all the nice stuff, `install-node.sh` will always get you the latest version of the Node.js binaries. To store your private settings, just add them to `~/.extra` (not included).

**For bash users:**  
`source ~/.dotfiles/bash_settings.sh`

**For zsh users:**  
`source ~/.dotfiles/zsh_settings.sh`

I also included three different zsh themes for [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/).

Have fun!
